## 🚀 About Me

Hi, I’m **Isa** - a startup-minded operator with CoS/Executive Assistant DNA, a love for app-building teams, and a personal mission to make every workplace feel like *the* place everyone wants to be.

I’ve supported CEOs, founders, creatives, engineers, and product teams across Europe, the UK, the US, and Asia. My strengths sit where **creative thinking meets operational excellence**:  
- turning chaos into clean process  
- planning unforgettable events & workations  
- managing global operations  
- bringing good energy to fast-moving teams  
- being the “team mom” with **cool aunt vibes™**

I thrive around people who **build things** — devs, designers, founders, makers.  
Corporate environments? Tried them. Improved their workflows. Got told:  
> “We prefer sticking with what’s working.” (🤮)

…so I went into the startup world where things actually *move*.
